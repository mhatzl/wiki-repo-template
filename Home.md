# Wiki that works with the [project-repo-template](https://github.com/mhatzl/project-repo-template)

Repository template to manage GitHub wikis that are synced with other GitHub projects.

The structure is loosely related to the [arc42 documentation](https://docs.arc42.org/home/).\
To create system models, you should take a look at [C4](https://c4model.com/) and the related [Structurizr DSL](https://structurizr.com/).

A short overview on how to use this wiki is given in [README.md](README.md).
