# GitHub Wiki Template

Repository template to manage a GitHub wiki that is synchronized with a GitHub project.\
This wiki is synchronized with the [project-repo-template](https://github.com/mhatzl/project-repo-template).

The structure is loosely related to the [arc42 documentation](https://docs.arc42.org/home/).\
To create system models, you should take a look at [C4](https://c4model.com/), and the related [Structurizr DSL](https://structurizr.com/).

This template is tailored to GitHub repositories, but the core concepts work for any project using a version control system.
