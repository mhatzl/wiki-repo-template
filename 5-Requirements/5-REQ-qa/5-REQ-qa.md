# qa: Quality Assurance

*QA* requirements help to ensure a high quality for the *project*.

**Note:** General *QA* requirements affect the overall architecture and implementation of the *project*, because they are not specific to a feature/functionality.
Therefore, these requirements must be considered for every existing or new feature/functionality, as long as these *QA* requirements are *active*.

**Note:** Only general *QA* requirements should be part of this requirement group. *QA* requirements that are specific to a requirement group should be added to a *qa* requirement subgroup for this feature.

## Active sub-requirements

- [req:qa.DoD](5-REQ-qa.DoD)
- [req:qa.tracing](5-REQ-qa.tracing)
